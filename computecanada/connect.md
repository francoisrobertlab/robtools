# Connecting to Compute Canada server

:memo: The examples use Beluga server

```
ssh beluga.computecanada.ca
cd scratch
ls
cd $dataset_name
```

`$dataset_name` is the folder containing the dataset files to be analyzed

The `ls` command is optional, but will help you find the dataset folder

## Notes
